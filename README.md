# MindShield

## Introduction

MindShield is an intelligent Android application designed to help users manage digital distractions and improve productivity. Leveraging AI-based content classification, MindShield monitors app usage in real time and uses advanced detection to identify and block distracting contentâ€”especially on platforms like YouTube. The app provides a seamless, user-friendly experience with robust overlays, notifications, and analytics, all while respecting user privacy.

## Use Case

MindShield is ideal for:
- **Students** who want to stay focused during study sessions and avoid time-wasting apps or content.
- **Professionals** seeking to minimize distractions during work hours and maintain productivity.
- **Parents** who wish to help their children develop healthy digital habits by monitoring and limiting access to distracting content.
- **Individuals** aiming for digital wellbeing, self-control, and a better understanding of their app usage patterns.

### Example Scenarios
- Blocking access to YouTube when AI detects distracting (entertainment) content, with a blur overlay and countdown timer.
- Providing real-time analytics and insights into daily and weekly app usage, highlighting top distracting apps.
- Enforcing break periods and grace intervals after dismissing distraction alerts, helping users build better habits.
- Ensuring overlays and notifications are only triggered by actual distracting content, not just app launches, for a non-intrusive experience.
